# SCNet-for-speech-enhancement
This repo provides the processed samples on the noisy audios of the VoiceBank_DEMAND noisy testet, which are enhanced by our SCNet model from the manuscript "Two-Stage Speech Enhancement Framework: Balancing Spectral Suppression and Compensation". The source code will be available later.
